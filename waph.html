    <h4>Course Information: In this course, I will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.<h4>

    <h4>Lab 1 Overview: Part I focuses on web fundamentals and HTTP using Wireshark to capture traffic from "example.com" and comparing HTTP requests via Telnet and a browser. In Part II, participants delve into basic web programming. Task 1 involves creating CGI web apps in C displayed on an Apache server. Task 2 introduces PHP with a "Hello World" program and HTTP GET requests. Task 3 explores understanding HTTP GET and POST using Wireshark and simulating an HTTP POST request with curl.<h4>

    <h4>Lab 2 Overview: I designed a webpage using HTML and JavaScript, incorporating features like interactive clocks and dynamic forms. Ajax facilitated server communication, and CSS provided styling, notably for buttons. jQuery streamlined Ajax requests, and the JokeAPI injected some response with AJAX GET request. The Agify API attempted age estimation, but real-time usage was restricted due to API limitations. In summary, the webpage integrated HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, and jQuery, offering an interactive and visually appealing experience.<h4>

    <h4> Hackathon 1 Overview: In Task 1, I demonstrated reflected cross-site scripting attacks on various levels of a website. This involved injecting scripts into input fields, manipulating URL parameters, and overcoming different filters. In Task 2, I implemented key defenses to enhance security:
    I updated the echo.php file with input validation using htmlentities() to sanitize and convert input into appropriate HTML characters. Additionally, I improved form validation by incorporating the validateInput() function. I replaced instances of innerHTML with innerText where HTML rendering was unnecessary, promoting security by displaying plain text. The introduction of the encodeInput() function further sanitized responses by converting special characters into HTML entities. Finally, validations were added to the API request for fetching jokes, ensuring both the received result and the result.joke within the JSON were not empty. These measures collectively strengthen the web application's security, mitigating potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities at various levels.<h4>
